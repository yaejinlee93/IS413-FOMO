        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>FOMO was founded in Montgomery, Alabama in 1905 by Art Freehling.
          To this day, Art’s continues to be owned and managed by his multi-generational
          family. It is staffed by knowledgeable people, each with a lengthy involvement
          in the musical world. As one of a handful of century-plus businesses in Alabama,
          Art’s has played an important role in the lives of thousands of musicians
          including band directors, students, professional musicians and organizations.
          Chances are, we probably helped start the very first program at your school.
          Art’s continues to operate this way today – by specializing in recruiting school
          bands and orchestras with an emphasis on careful testing to direct each and every
          child to the instrument best suited to their needs.
